I use a lot of different apps for my stuff. And I wanted to automate syncing, transferring & displaying the data between them
<br>
Because...well...who doesn't love [efficient, error-free] automation?

Backend on Azure [here](https://integrator-backend.azurewebsites.net/) (sorry if it isn't running at the moment, i often stop the server whenever I don't need it)

More tools coming soon (when i figure out integrating them)...
