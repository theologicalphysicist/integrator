i use a lot of different apps for my stuff. and i wanted to automate syncing, transferring & displaying the data between them.
<br>
because...well...who doesn't love [efficient, error-free] automation?

backend on azure [here](https://integrator-backend.azurewebsites.net/) (sorry if it isn't running at the moment, i often stop the server whenever i don't need it).

more tools coming soon (when i figure out integrating them)...
